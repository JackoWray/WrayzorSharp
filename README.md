## Code Refactoring-Horiseon

The goal was to keep the web page's display and functionality unchanged, only to chance the index.html and the style.css to exhibit more semantic elements rather than repeating the div element for all portions of the code.

The style.css was also editted to condense a lot of the selectors to make the css shorter and easier to read. This was acheived by both changing the selctors and re-working the existing class and element selectors.
